# electrical-fault-prediction

This is a electrical line fault prediction model based on classification algorithms. The data is of 3 phase transmission line voltage and currents. These were made based on transmission line system of **Bangladesh**.
The dataset was obtained from a test `simulink` model.  It contains 12000 data points.

> The next approach is to predict the type of fault.
